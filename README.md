# Realtor App: Building a Scalable Web Application with Nest.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

(POSTGRESQL IS CLOSED BECAUSE OF COSTS!)

## Overview

Welcome to my project, which leverages the power of Nest.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL to build a robust and scalable web application. This project embodies modern development practices, utilizing a strong, typed language, an efficient backend framework, an ORM for database interaction, and a powerful relational database.

## Technology Stack

### 1. Nest.js

[Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) is a progressive Node.js framework that serves as the foundation for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It embraces modern design principles and enables the creation of well-organized, maintainable, and testable code.

### 2. TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to your development workflow. This enables better code quality, improved tooling, and enhanced developer productivity.

### 3. Prisma

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is a modern database toolkit that simplifies database access with an auto-generated query builder. It allows us to work with databases using a type-safe API, making database interactions more efficient and secure.

### 4. PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its extensibility, robustness, and support for various data types. It's an excellent choice for building scalable and reliable applications.

## Project Objectives

Our project aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Efficient Backend Development**: Utilize Nest.js to rapidly develop a backend with well-structured code and powerful features.

2. **Type-Safe Code**: Leverage TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the application, minimizing runtime errors and providing an enhanced developer experience.

3. **Robust Database Interactions**: Utilize Prisma to handle database interactions seamlessly, ensuring optimal performance and reliable data management.

4. **Scalable Database Solution**: Utilize PostgreSQL as a scalable and robust relational database, enabling our application to handle data effectively as it grows.

5. **Maintainability and Readability**: Adhere to best practices and coding standards to ensure that the codebase is maintainable, easy to read, and scalable as the project evolves.

- The `ValidationPipe` is used for request body validation, ensuring that the provided data adheres to the defined DTOs.

### Additional Notes

- Users who want to sign up as buyers do not need a product key.
- For admin and realtor sign-ups, a valid product key is required. The product key is generated using the provided email and user type and is hashed before validation.

## Conclusion

By combining the strengths of Nest.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, we are on the path to building a high-quality web application that meets our objectives of efficiency, type safety, robust database interactions, scalability, and maintainability.
